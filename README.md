# Task_5

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

# Overview

This project is part of my Data Analyst Internship Task 5, where I perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python on the given dataset.
The goal is to extract insights, identify patterns, trends, and anomalies through statistical summaries and visualizations.

# Dataset

File Name: tested.xlsx


# Tools and Libraries

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab)


# Steps Performed

1. Loading and Understanding Data

Used .info(), .describe(), .value_counts() to explore basic statistics.

Checked for missing values and data types.



2. Data Visualization

Plotted Histograms for distribution understanding.

Created Boxplots to detect outliers.

Used Pairplots for visualizing relationships between variables.

Created a Heatmap to visualize correlation between numerical features.

Developed Scatterplots to check specific variable relationships.



3. Observations

Documented key insights after each plot and table.

Highlighted distribution patterns, outliers, correlations, and trends.
